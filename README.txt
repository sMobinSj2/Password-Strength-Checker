Password Strength Checker

This simple Python program helps you check how strong your password is.

A strong password should:
    1. Be at least 8 characters long
    2. Not start with a number
    3. Not start with a lowercase letter
    4. Include at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)

How to use:
1. clone the repository to your local machine.    
2. Make sure you have Python installed.    or     You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Run the main.py file.
4. Follow the prompts to enter your password.

At the end, if the password meets all the criteria, it will copy the password to your clipboard for easy use.
