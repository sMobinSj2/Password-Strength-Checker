Password Strength Checker

This simple Python program helps you check how strong your password is.

A strong password should:
    1. Be at least 8 characters long
    2. Not start with a number
    3. Not start with a lowercase letter
    4. Include at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)

At the end, if the password meets all the criteria, it will copy the password to your clipboard for easy use.
